Malicious URL Classification
A comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for detecting and classifying malicious URLs into five categories: benign, defacement, phishing, malware, and spam. This repository contains Python code for:

Data Merging (combining multiple CSVs into one dataset)

Preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers; encoding categorical labels)

Balancing (addressing class imbalance with SMOTE or other techniques)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (descriptive statistics, meaningful visualizations)

Feature Extraction (structural features, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, transformer embeddings, character-level models)

Machine Learning & LLM-Based Models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LSTM, CNN, and fine-tuned BERT/GPT)

Results Visualization (confusion matrices, ROC curves, accuracy comparisons)
